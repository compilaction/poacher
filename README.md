# poacher
The Library That Hunts Bisons - A collection of C++constexpr langages parsers

## Objectives
`constexpr` computation is all the rage in post-C++17 world. Works by  [Hana Dusikova](https://github.com/hanickadot) on compile-time regular
expressions and some great pioneering by [Jason Turner and Ben Deane](https://github.com/lefticus/constexpr_all_the_things/tree/master/src/include) show that parsing arbitrary data or langages from
compile-time available string is a very valuable techniques.

Poacher has the goal to provide an extensible framework to easily defines such constexpr parser for arbitrary langages and
to provide some well known langages ready-to-use compile time parsers.
